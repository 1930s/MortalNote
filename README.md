# MortalNote

MortalNote is an Evernote clone that implements pixel perfect replication and identical, albeit limited, functionality. 

MortalNote implements CSS grid technology to enhance the web application's responsiveness. This allows MortalNote to be a more responsive webpage than Evernote. 

MortalNote is the creation of Benji Rothman, as well as the students and TA's at App Academy. Without the support of his community, Benji would not have been able to complete this project.
